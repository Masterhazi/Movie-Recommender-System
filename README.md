## 1. The Story Behind MARS üöÄ

Imagine you're sitting on your couch, flipping through Netflix, and you just can't decide what to watch. You've seen all the classics, you‚Äôre tired of the trending films, and you're craving something different. That's where MARS comes to the rescue! 

Instead of endlessly scrolling through platforms, MARS harnesses the power of Google‚Äôs advanced AI and suggests movies based on *synopsis similarity*, using deep learning to find you the perfect movie match. Think of it as a personal movie critic who never runs out of recommendations!

## 2. Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è

MARS is built with a few essential tools that allow it to work its magic:

- **Streamlit** - For the clean and responsive web interface.
- **Langchain** - To create seamless workflows between the input and AI models.
- **Google Generative AI** - To generate movie recommendations based on movie titles, genres, or keywords.
- **Dotenv** - To securely manage API keys for the model configuration.

---

## 3. How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è

Let‚Äôs break down how MARS works behind the scenes.

### 3.1 Setting Up the Local Environment üñ•Ô∏è

Before MARS can start making any recommendations, the environment must be set up to handle API calls to Google‚Äôs AI services. This is done using `dotenv`, which loads environment variables securely.

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()  # Activate the local environment
```

With this, we load the necessary API key for the Google Generative AI model:

```python
genai.configure(api_key=os.getenv('GOOGLE-API-KEY'))
```

### 3.2 Designing the Webpage üé®

To make the user experience easy and fun, MARS uses **Streamlit** to provide a clean, user-friendly interface. Users can enter a movie title, genre, or keyword of their choice. 

```python
st.title("MARS (Automated Movie Recommender System) ‚úÖ")
movie_input = st.text_input('Enter the Movie title, genre or keyword üéûÔ∏è')
```

The input from the user is captured and used to generate tailored movie recommendations based on the similarity of film synopses.

### 3.3 Building the AI Model üß†

At the core of MARS is **Langchain**, which helps structure our input and output into a flow that interacts with Google‚Äôs powerful **Generative AI** model. The prompt that drives the recommendations is wrapped in a `PromptTemplate`, designed to use the user‚Äôs input dynamically.

```python
demo_template = '''Based on {movie_input}, give me the best 5 movie recommendations by their similarity of the synopsis of the film'''
template = PromptTemplate(input_variables=[movie_input], template=demo_template)
```

We then initialize Google‚Äôs **ChatGoogleGenerativeAI** model:

```python
llm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model='gemini-pro', api_key=os.getenv('GOOGLE-API-KEY'))
```

### 3.4 Making Movie Recommendations üçø

Once the user enters their movie-related query, MARS runs the model and returns five movie recommendations based on the input.

```python
llm_chain = LLMChain(prompt=template, llm=llm)
recommendations = llm.predict(text=prompt)
st.write(f'Recommendations for you:\n {recommendations}')
```

## 4. Running the Application üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### Pre-requisites:
- Python 3.7+
- A valid Google API key (configured in your `.env` file)

### Steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/MARS.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd MARS
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

Now, open the URL generated by Streamlit in your browser and start getting movie recommendations!

## 6. Future Enhancements üöÄ

While MARS is already a cool tool for movie recommendations, there's always room for growth! Here are a few ideas for future development:
- **Add more filters**: Incorporate filters based on user preferences like runtime, language, etc.
- **User ratings**: Allow users to rate the recommendations and improve results.
- **TV shows**: Expand beyond movies to include TV show recommendations.
